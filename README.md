## Work in Progress

## Overview

This Finance App is a full-stack web application built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Python for scraping financial data from Yahoo Finance. Additionally, the app incorporates homomorphic encryption for secure machine learning operations on financial data.

## Features

- **React Frontend**: A modern and responsive user interface for interacting with financial data.
- **Node.js Backend**: Serves as the backend server to handle requests from the frontend and interact with the Python scripts for data scraping.
- **Python Data Scraping**: Utilizes Python scripts to scrape financial data from Yahoo Finance, providing real-time and historical market information.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Implements homomorphic encryption to enable secure computation on encrypted financial data, ensuring privacy during machine learning operations.
